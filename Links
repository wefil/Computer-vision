1. Look at standard datasets and tasks and list (Like MNIST)

    - Classification, Identification, Segmentation

    - Image Denoising (Wiener Filters, MAP and Autoencoder)

    - Image Enhancement (Intensity Transformations, Contract enhancement, histogram processing, spatial filtering)

    - Image Restoration (Inverse Fileter, Wiener Filter, MAP Formulation, Wavelets)

    - Face Detection (Eigen Faces, Viola Jones, CNN)

    - Image Dehazing

1. Preprocessing techniques

1. Models

    - Model Architectures (DenseNet, ResNet etc)

    - Pretrained Models (Fine tuning)

    - Evaluation Metrics

1. Try the Sample Questions
